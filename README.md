# Advent of code 2019

I tackled 2018's AoC in C, and it was a lot of fun.

For a bit more challenge, 2019 is the year of Haskell. I am a total novice in Haskell. No doubt there are many howlers and inefficiencies here. One day I'll come back and rewrite it all with idiomatic one-liners. But, for now, I'm enjoying the different way that Haskell forces you to think about problems.
